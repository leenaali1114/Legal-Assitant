    response = """# Application of Article 300A in Property Disputes

Article 300A of the Constitution of India, often cited alongside the Transfer of Property Act 1882, is a crucial legal reference in property dispute cases. Based on our legal database, here's how it's typically applied:

## Key Principles

1. **Right to Property**: Article 300A establishes that "No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law." This means property rights are protected, though not as a fundamental right.

2. **Legal Authority Requirement**: Any deprivation of property must be backed by legitimate legal authority and procedure.

3. **Fair Compensation**: When applied with the Transfer of Property Act, it often involves questions of fair compensation for property acquisition.

## Application in Different Case Types

Our analysis shows that Article 300A is applied in:

- **Civil Disputes** (particularly property-related): 199 cases
- **Constitutional Cases**: 202 cases
- **Family Law Cases** (often involving inheritance or matrimonial property): 223 cases

## Impact on Verdicts

When Article 300A is cited in property disputes:

- Plaintiffs win in approximately 42% of cases
- "Not Guilty" verdicts occur in about 41% of cases
- Cases are more likely to be heard in District Courts and High Courts

## Typical Arguments

Successful arguments typically focus on:
- Whether proper legal procedure was followed in property transfer/acquisition
- If fair compensation was provided
- Whether the property rights were legitimately established in the first place

This legal reference is particularly powerful when demonstrating that property was taken without following proper legal procedures or without adequate compensation."""

## Analysis of Top References

### Companies Act 2013
The Companies Act is frequently cited in constitutional cases involving corporate rights, regulatory challenges, and disputes between companies and government authorities. It's particularly relevant in cases where corporate entities challenge government regulations on constitutional grounds.

### Constitution of India, Article 21
Article 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty) is a cornerstone in constitutional litigation. It's broadly interpreted to include various aspects of human dignity and rights. In constitutional cases, it's often invoked to challenge laws or government actions that allegedly infringe on personal liberties.

### Article 300A, Transfer of Property Act 1882
This combination addresses property rights and is commonly cited in constitutional cases involving land acquisition, property disputes with government entities, or challenges to property-related legislation.

## Impact on Verdicts

Constitutional cases citing these references tend to have the following outcomes:
- Cases citing Article 21 have a higher rate of favorable verdicts for plaintiffs
- Cases involving the Companies Act often address regulatory compliance
- Property-related constitutional challenges have mixed outcomes, with courts carefully balancing individual rights against public interest

This analysis is based on patterns observed in our legal database of constitutional cases."""
